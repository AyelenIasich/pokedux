# Pokedux: Pok√©mon Explorer App

Pokedux is an application built with **React** and configured with **Vite** to explore the first 151 Pok√©mon from the first generation. This project aims to practice and reinforce advanced **Redux** concepts.

## Project Goals

- Learn and practice **Redux** fundamentals.
- Implement advanced patterns such as middlewares, **Redux Thunk**, and **Redux Toolkit**.
- Integrate immutability libraries like **Immutable.js**.
- Create a visually appealing and functional interface.

## Concepts Implemented

This project incorporates the following concepts and tools:

1. **Redux Fundamentals**: Centralized state and data management.
2. **Redux Lifecycle**: Understanding how data flows within Redux.
3. **Redux vs Context API**: Differences and when to use each.
4. **Custom Middlewares**: Creation and implementation of custom middlewares.
5. **Redux Thunk**: Middleware to handle asynchronous actions.
6. **Redux DevTools**: Advanced debugging for Redux.
7. **Redux Saga**: Handling side effects and complex flows.
8. **Immutability**: Using **Immutable.js** to ensure state immutability.
9. **Redux Toolkit**:
   - `createSlice`: Simplification of reducers and actions.
   - `createAsyncThunk`: Handling asynchronous actions with Redux Toolkit.
10. **Combined Reducers**: Modular organization of reducers.
11. **Integration with Connect and Hooks**: Using `connect` alongside `useSelector`/`useDispatch`.


## Technologies Used

- **React**: Library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: Development tool for a fast and lightweight environment.
- **Redux**: State management library for the application.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Simplified setup for Redux.
- **Immutable.js**: Ensuring immutability in the state.
- **Modern CSS**: Responsive and visually attractive design.
